## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Variable font files

### What I learned

I'm not really proud of CSS in this one, it's very messy. I guess I have to start using Sass.  
Despite that I'm satisfied that I managed to use clip-path for the rounded background sections and the secondary button action on hover.

```css
  clip-path: ellipse(150% 95% at 50% 0);
```
